#	pivysnort.py v1.1 by Mario R. De Tore, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory
#	
#	Useful for generating Snort signature content for known PI passwords and conducting 
#   dictionary attacks against traffic from implants using an unknown password.
#
#   Usage: pivysnort.py [options]
#
#   Options:
#      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
#      -p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD
#                            Plaintext Poison Ivy password
#      -k KEY, --key=KEY     A key in plain hex format
#      -a, --all             Print full Snort signature vice just msg, content and
#                            depth (you must edit the SID)
#      -x, --experimental    Include experimental signatures
#      -r PCAP, --read=PCAP  Attempt to crack PI password for supplied PI traffic
#                            in PCAP format. If a password or key argument is
#                            supplied that password or key will be tried. Additional
#                            passwords can be piped in via STDIN

#
#   pivysnort now includes the capability to ingest network traffic (libpcap/tcpdump 
#   formats, not pcapng) to attempt recovery of a PI implant password via a dictionary 
#   attack. This works by extracting encrypted portions of the PI handshake or encrypted 
#   heartbeats and then running a dictionary attack in an attempt to guess the password 
#   needed to decrypt the traffic. Candidate passwords can be piped to the script:
#
#   cat passwords.txt | ./pivysnort.py -r ~/evil.pcap 
#   ./john --wordlist=passwords.txt --rules --stdout | ./pivysnort.py -r ~/evil.pcap
#
#	A number of common APT passwords as documented in FireEye's PI report are checked by 
#   default. These can be updated manually via pw_list. Passwords are entered as strings, 
#   keys are entered as integers (the script will do the needed conversions at run-time).
#
#
#   Note that neither a full PI handshake or full duplex traffic are required for this
#   technique to work. 
#
#	The following resources provided much appreciated technical insights on the PI 
#	protocol:
#	https://www.fireeye.com/resources/pdfs/fireeye-poison-ivy-report.pdf
#	https://github.com/MITRECND/chopshop/blob/master/modules/poisonivy_23x.py
#
#	PI utilizes camellia for encryption which has a 16 byte blocksize. Prior to encryption
#	data to be sent over the wire is prepended with a 32 byte header as described in the 
#	above resources:
#
#		struct PI_chunk_header {
#		int command_id;
#		int stream_id;
#		int padded_chunk_size;
#		int chunk_size;
#		int decompressed_chunk_size;
#		long total_stream_size;
#		int padding;
#		}
#
#	One of the unique characteristics of PI is that the implant is a stub loader - most
#	modules are pushed as shellcode to the implant "on demand". Because of this we can
#	reliably predict what the initial 16 bytes of traffic needed for a Snort signature 
#	from the server to the client will be once a module is put in use. This reliance on 
#	shellcode transfer is also reflected in traffic after the initial 256 byte handshake. 
#	Immediately after the handshake the server will push an initial shellcode load 
#	prepended by the byte sequence  "d0150000" which is the shellcode payload length in 
#	NBO. Note that these four bytes are unencrypted unlike the shellcode that follows.
#
#	One caveat to predicting the initial 16 byte header is the use of stream IDs by PI
#	to allow multiple simultaneous network connections. The predicted header primitives, 
#	called prototypes within this script, were generated with the assumption that only
#	one  or two streams would be active at a time. Additional prototypes would need to be 
#	added for coverage in scenarios beyond two simultaneous connections (could be an issue
#	if the actor is active while transferring multiple large files). Additionally, this 
#	script currently only supports generating signatures for traffic with PI implants 
#	operating in direct connection mode, not via SOCKS or HTTP proxies (rare).
#
#	All generated signatures are for traffic from the C2 server to the affected client
#	since we can not reliably predict what the headers will be from the client. The one 
#	exception is the client heartbeat - this stays consistent and contains no host
#	specific data.
#
#	Limited testing has shown the following signatures to be reliable across different PI 
#	configurations (e.g. persistence, process injection, etc):
#
#	PI init shellcode
#	PI heartbeat(server)
#	PI heartbeat(client)
#	PI command shell
#	
#	The remaining signatures seem to only hit on specific configurations. This may require
#	additional configuration-specific signatures for each password.
#
#	v1.0: 07-Dec-2014
#	v1.0.1: 07-Dec-2014 - Fixed typos, added more signature prototypes.
#	v1.0.2: 08-Dec-2014 - Updated comments with testing findings. Reordered script
#	output accordingly.
#	v1.0.3: 09-Dec-2014 - Added -x options to segregate reliable sigs from experimental
#	v1.1: 12-Dec-2014 - Added option to read traffic from pcap and conduct a dictionary
#	attack if PI implant traffic is detected. Fixed a bunch of bugs.
